## Checkers-Game
MiniCheckers Game
Overview
The MiniCheckers Game is a simplified version of the traditional checkers game built using Java. This project demonstrates the basics of game development in Java, including board creation, player interaction, and simple game logic.

Features

8x8 Game Board: Represents a standard checkers board layout with alternating black and white squares.
Basic Game Logic: Set up for implementing rules and movements for each piece on the board.
Player Interaction: Placeholder structure for managing two-player game functionality.

Getting Started
Navigate to the project directory:



cd MiniCheckersGame
Run the game:



cd src/main/java

javac com/minicheckers/CheckersGame.java

java com.minicheckers.CheckersGame

How to Play

This initial version sets up an 8x8 checkers board, but it doesn't include movement or capturing logic yet. The goal of this project is to expand the code base by adding rules and piece movements.

Future Enhancements
Implement piece movement and capturing logic.
Add player classes to handle user input for moves.
Create basic AI to allow single-player mode.
Technologies Used
Java: The main programming language used to build the game.
